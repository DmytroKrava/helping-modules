# Helping modules for a system of complex eco-energy-economic monitoring (CEEEM)

I created these modules during implementation of bachelor graduate work.
These modules help beginning users to get information about unknown elements of CEEEM. There are two modules: _interactive-hints_ and _instruction_.

## Module "interactive-hints"
In module "interactive-hints" implemented such elemts of helping system as tooltip, modal window, audio prompt. This module consists of two elements:
- JavaScript-file "interactive-hints.js"
- CSS-file "style.css"

The video with work of elements of this module on CEEEM you can find in this module.

## Module "instruction"
The module "instruction" implements a web-page with functional, which contains all information about elements of CEEEM. User can read it, if there is unknown situation during work with the site.
This module consists of such elements:
- XML-like file "instruction.jsx" (Used such format because CEEEM was built with using React)
- CSS-file "instruction.css"
- folder 'images'

The video with work of elements of this module on CEEEM you can find in this module.


## Acquired skills
In this project I mastered:
- Basics of JavaScript
- JavaScript DOM
- Basics of HTML
- Basics of CSS
- CSS Grids
- CSS Media

## Running of modules
***Because of this project is not mine,*** I uploaded only modules created by me, but not full version of CEEEM. Therefore you can not run these modules. But I recorded on video the work of these modules on the web-site. As I said before, ***you can find these videos in modules***.
